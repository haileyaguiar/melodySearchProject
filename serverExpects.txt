Here is the object the server is expecting when it deserializes the http request body:

public class ReqPartialMusic {
   Record source;
   Map<String, List<String>> highlight;
}

Here is the Record object:

public class Record {
    private String name;
    private String intervals_text;
    private String measure_map;
    private int[] intervals_as_array;
    private int[] measure_map_as_array;
}

Note that we find the record and highlight from the server response when we "/searchMusic"
